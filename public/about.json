    "bio": "Thanks for checking out my web development portfolio! I'm a software engineer with expertise in JavaScript for both front-end and back-end development, along with React, HTML, and various CSS frameworks. I’m also experienced with Python for back-end programming using Django, and for general scripting. What really excites me about the work is the challenge of solving complex problems and finding creative solutions. Before transitioning to a career in tech, I spent years in higher education as a student services professional. I’m a lifelong learner and have built a culture of self-betterment, growth mindset, and strengths-based learning. I bring these lessons to every project I work on, seeing each opportunity as a chance to learn and grow. In addition to my technical skills, I have experience working as a technical recruiter at Meta Platforms, Inc. This experience gave me valuable insights into what employers are looking for in their candidates, from entry-level to management roles. I'm confident that this experience, combined with my technical expertise, would make me a valuable asset to any team. Ultimately, what sets me apart as a web developer is my passion for discovery and exploration. I love tackling new challenges and finding innovative solutions, whether it's through experimenting with new algorithms or pushing the boundaries of traditional frameworks. I hope you'll take a look at my projects below and consider me for your team."
